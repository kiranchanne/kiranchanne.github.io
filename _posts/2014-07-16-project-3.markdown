description: Ned2 is a 6-axis robot designed for robustness and precision. I have completed multiple tasks such as pick-and-place operations, pneumatic actuation, workplace simulation, and precise end-effector trajectory planning. This experience allowed me to develop skills in robotic automation, forward and inverse kinematics, transformations, motion planning, and real-time control, All actions were implemented using Python. Check out my GitHub for more details!
