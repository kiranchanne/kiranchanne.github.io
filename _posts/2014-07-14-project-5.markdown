description: Developed a temperature-sensing control system by implementing a TMP36 analog thermometer with a PIC24 microcontroller. I integrated ADC routines for precise signal acquisition, configured UART for asynchronous serial communication, and programmed real-time fan control based on temperature thresholds. I gained experience in embedded system design, microcontroller programming, analog-to-digital conversion and sensor-driven automation.
