description: An ongoing project that explores heart-rate variability (HRV) features extracted from ECG segments to classify psychological stress. Using a dataset of 50+ participants exposed to spider video clips, ECG signals are filtered, R-peaks are detected with the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, and time- and frequency-domain HRV features are computed. Features are standardized and analyzed using logistic regression with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. This project provides experience in ECG signal processing, HRV feature extraction, and artifact removal. All implementation and analysis done in MATLAB.
