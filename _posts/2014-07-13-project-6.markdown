description: Developed an electromyogram (EMG) device to measure biceps brachii activity. The design included a signal processing circuit with differential and inverting amplifiers, high- and low-pass filters, and a full-wave rectifier to amplify and refine the EMG signal while minimizing noise. The EMG data was digitized and transmitted to an Arduino microcontroller for real-time analysis, using thresholding to automatically detect muscle contraction and relaxation. Gained experience in biomedical instrumentation, analog signal processing, microcontroller interfacing, and real-time signal analysis using LabView, Arduino IDE and Python.
